# Medical-Cost-Prediction
Developed a medical cost prediction model using linear regression, random forest regressor, gadient boosting regressor and neural networks to estimate healthcare costs based on patient attributes such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

Evaluated the performance of the models using common regression metrics: mean error squarred, mean absolute error, R squrred, and visualizations.

Implemented the models in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
